This game is called Crystals Collector!

The page will randomly display a number. This is the number that you are trying to match to win the game!

Each crystal will be randomly given a value. These values are hidden from you until you click on each one.
Click the various crystals until the total adds up to the random target value.

If you match the numbers an alert will appear saying "You won!" and your wins will increase by 1.
If you go over the target number an alert will appear saying "You lost!" and your losses will increase by 1.

After either a win or a loss, the game will reset with a new target number and new crystal values.

Good Luck!
